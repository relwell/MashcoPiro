## A chrome extension for killing the YouTube Guide ##

*Once upon a time, YouTube decided that the actual video content shouldn't be close to the upper left-hand corner.*
*And all the people who changed the size of their window to view just the video content wept with anger.*
*"Why would they try to force me to look at even more crap I don't want to see? Every feature except the video player sucks,"*
*wept the people. And so, like the Amazonian Mashco-Piro tribe, they killed the guide with primitive technology.*
