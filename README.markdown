## A chrome extension for killing the YouTube Guide ##

*Once upon a time, YouTube decided that the actual video content shouldn't be close to the upper left-hand corner.*

*And all the people who changed the size of their window to view just the video content wept with anger.*

*"Why would they try to force me to look at even more crap I don't want to see? Every feature except the video player sucks,"*

*wept the people. And so, like the Amazonian Mashco-Piro tribe, they killed the guide with primitive technology.*

## Installation Instructions ##
*  Download the [zip file](https://github.com/relwell/MashcoPiro/zipball/master) and extract it
*  Put it someplace you don't mind keeping it
*  In Chrome, click on the wrench in the upper right-hand corner, and select "extensions"
*  Make sure "developer mode" is clicked
*  Click "load unpacked extension", and select the folder you unzipped
*  Restart Chrome

You can tell it's working if the guide automatically disappears in YouTube.
